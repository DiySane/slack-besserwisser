# Build a besserwisser bot for Slack with BERT
Philipp here at Peltarion got the brilliant idea to play around with the newly released BERT. He wanted to see if he could make a model for identifying patterns in Slack messages and tell people if they posted in the wrong channel.

It turned out he could. And you can do it too! If you need another besserwisser (do you, really?) at work, hereâ€™s how to build one:

_Target audience_: Data scientists and developers


## You will learn to
* Collect and preprocess data.
* Use BERT - We have prebuilt the whole BERT network as a snippet, that is, you don't have to build this huge network yourself.
* Set your model live on Slack.
